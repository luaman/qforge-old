QuakeForge Errata
-----------------

This file contains a listing of all major issues and problems found in the
QuakeForge engine.  Generally problems will find their way here along with
the person who reported the problem so we can verify it's fixed when we
do fix it.  Feature requests will usually go into the file WISHLIST.

Joseph Carter <knghtbrd@debian.org>
 - View in UQuake starts off-map and never changes
 - GLX error on exit:  "XIO:  fatal IO error 9 (Bad file descriptor) on X
                              server ":0.0" after 65 requests (64 known
			      processed) with 0 events remaining."

Tonik <tonik@quake.ru>
 - qw-server hangs in win32 (knghtbrd). Well i kinda fixed it in my tree (Tonik)
 - the real problem is, client connection process doesn't go any further
   after the 'CONNECTING' stage, and that really sucks :(
