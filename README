This is the current CVS source for QuakeForge, our tree for the future
unification of the Quake and QuakeWorld sources. I wish I could say more, but
we're currently working hard on getting the original Quake to compile under the
merged tree. Once it's compiling and running in the current state, merging and
enhancement will continue. :)
