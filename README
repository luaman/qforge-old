I. Special Thanks
-----------------

The QuakeForge Project would like to thank Id Software, Inc. for writing
and releasing Quake under the GNU GPL.  We'd like to thank John Carmack and
Dave Kirsch in particular for the support they have provided to us and to
the Free Software community as a whole.

We would also like to thank the following organizations for their
contributions to QuakeForge:

   VA Linux Systems, Inc.
   3Dfx Interactive, Inc.

And last but certainly not least, we would like to thank every single
person who has contributed even one line of code, documentation, or other
support to the QuakeForge project.

Without all of you, we would not be where we are right now.

FIXME: Who are MPath Interactive and Gandalf Tech and what'd they do?


II. System Requirements
-----------------------

VGA-compatible display
8MB RAM (16MB required under Win32)
Floating-point processor
30MB free disk space (shareware version, 80MB for registered version)


III. Running and Compiling Quake
--------------------------------

Read the INSTALL file for more information on compiling.

After you have compiled successfully, you must download the shareware
version of Quake 1 to play. Insert the proper binaries in the same
directory as the unpacked shareware files, and run.


IV. Operating System Specific Issues
------------------------------------

This section should discuss issues that affect only certain operating
platforms.  Issues to be discussed include:

  * Audio Setup
  * CD Audio Input
  * Mouse Setup
  * Booting "Clean"


V. Errata and Known Bugs
------------------------

Problem:  The screen flickers once about every other frame when using GL
Solution: Not all GL implementations support a performance hack used to
          which is used by the GL renderer allowing it to avoid clearing
	  the Z buffer.  The console command "gl_ztrick 0" fixes this
	  problem.

Problem:  Zombies can sometimes get "stuck" in the ground.  They can be
          heard but not killed making it impossible to get 100% on the
	  current level.
Solution: None found.

Problem:  It is possible for players to sometimes get stuck in a room or
          wall, much like the zombies mentioned above.
Solution: The "kill" console command will un-stick you, but it has the
          unfortunate side effect of killing you in the process (hence the
	  command's name.)  It is a good idea to save your games often.

Problem:  Sometimes durring a game the player's view will not center
          properly.  The end result is that the player view is looking up
	  toward the ceiling while walking.
Solution: Use of freelook (mouse or keyboard) may solve this problem, as
          will exiting the level or the "kill" console command.


VI. Troubleshooting
-------------------

If Quake fails to start up, or has problems not addressed elsewhere in the
documentation, try the -safe command line switch, which disables a number
of parts of Quake that can be problems if there are hardware or
configuration problems.  The -safe command line switch is equivalent to 
-stdvid, -nosound, -nonet, and -nocdaudio together.  Those four switches
do the following:

  -stdvid	disables VESA video modes
  -nosound	disables sound card support
  -nonet	disables network card support
  -nocdaudio	disables CD audio support

If -safe makes the problem go away, try using each of the switches
individually to isolate the area in which you're experiencing the problem,
then either correct the configuration or hardware problem or play Quake
with that functionality disabled.

If you still have problems, try booting clean in conjunction with the
-safe command line parameter.  For information on booting clean, refer to 
"Booting Clean" in section III above.

If you experience page faults while running Quarterdeck's QDPMI DPMI
server, this is caused by a bug in QDPMI.  Workarounds:  Remove QDPMI from
CONFIG.SYS, issue the command QDPMI OFF before running QUAKE, or get the
update patch for QDPMI from Quarterdeck.  You may be running QDPMI without
knowing it if you have QEMM installed, because it can be installed as part
of the QEMM installation.


VII. Technical Support
----------------------

Please do *not* call ID Software, Inc regarding technical support issues
related to QuakeForge.  QuakeForge is heavily modified from the original
Quake source release and they wouldn't be likely to even know how to help
you with such problems.  Instead visit the QuakeForge project webpage for
information on technical support at:  http://www.quakeforge.net

Thank you for your understanding.


VIII. Joystick notes
--------------------

Your joystick must be plugged in when Quake is launched.

If you have a joystick plugged in, but do not wish QuakeForge to try to
use it, just add the -nojoy option to the QuakeForge command line.

You may disable joystick reads from the QuakeForge console with the 
"joystick 0" command.

There are default configuration bindings for joystick buttons.

If your joystick or interface card reports three or four buttons and you
only have two, use the QuakeForge console command "joybuttons 2".

The "mlook" and "sidestep" commands work with a joystick exactly as they
do for a mouse, as does the "invert mouse up/down" menu option.
