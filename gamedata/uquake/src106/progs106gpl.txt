================================================================

* What has been fixed *

#1 Changed occasional unix new lines into dos newlines
   Now all lines end with 0x0D 0x0A

#2 Added GPL header to all files besides progs.src

#3 Added fix for walkframe leak bug in player_run() of player.qc
   Changed (self.walkframe == 6) into (self.walkframe >= 6) according to
   player_stand1

#4 Fixed typo in misc_fireball() of misc.qc
   Changed self.speed == 1000 into self.speed = 1000

#5 Added fix for fishes counted twice in monsters.qc
   Removed total_monsters line in swimmonster_start_go()

#6 The spawn function of the Shalrath calls "walkmonster_start()" not directly
   like the other monsters
   Replaced self.think/self.nextthink lines with call of walkmonster_start()

#7 Added fix for incorrect setting of nextthink (to v1.06 only)
   In some functions .nextthink is not set correctly, so sometimes monster stop
   or even do not ever start to walk.
   Always use the current time to set ".nextthink", also always add a constant
   value to it as the "random()" function can also return a zero (0 * x = 0!)
   Fly and swim monsters can be affected by gravity, so they have to be made
   gravity-resistant in the start function.
   misc_fireball() in misc.qc
   monster_start() and monster_start_go() in monsters.qc
   ogre_smash11() in ogre.qc
   sham_magic3() in shambler.qc
   zombie_paine11() in zombie.qc

#8 Added fix for "NoExit" variable recognized SinglePlayer/Coop
   Check for deathmatch in changelevel_touch() of client.qc

#9 Added fix for "TimeLimit" and "FragLimit" variables recognized SinglePlayer/Coop
   Check for deathmatch in CheckRules() of client.qc

#10 Added fix Teamplay 1 mode, so players can hurt themselves
    Check for attacker, player class and door in T_Damage() of combat.qc

#11 Corrected other non-code typos...
    allready -> already
    chagnelevel -> changelevel
    Super Nailgun -> Perforator (in items.qc, according to the Quake manual)

#12 Added missing parameter on some function calls (for Mr. Elusive's MeQCC)
    - DropToFloor(0,0) calls in items.qc, misc.qc, monsters.qc
    - MakeStatic(self) call in misc.qc
    - ai_charge(0) call in ogre.qc

#13 Corrected size of "info_teleport_destination" entity for QuakeED
    and other editors (e.g. StoneLess, QEradiant)

#14 Removed all empty lines at end of files
