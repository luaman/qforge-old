* To those who still don't understand this simple fact:
We can NOT use _ftime for Win9x, because on Win9x it has 1/18.2 sec resolution!
If you don't like timeGetTime(), c'mon, use that QueryPerformanceCounter() from
WinQuake. But _ftime is what simply CANNOT be used.
_ftime works fine on NT, though...
