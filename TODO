This file contains a (very incomplete) list of things to do still with the
QuakeForge project.  If you'd like to add something to this list or point
out that something has been done we forgot to remove, please send an email
to quake-devel@lists.sourceforge.net with details.

 * On unix systems /etc/quakerc should be read as a system-wide config
   file which should be able to specify console commands and other things
   like where to find the id1, qw, and other -game specified dirs
 * On unix systems ~/.quake should overlay a shared data directory.  Files
   in a user's ~/.quake directory should take precedence over files in the
   shared data dir and all files written should be placed into ~/.quake
 * Devise and implement a way to ensure original gameplay compatibility
   while still letting us expand and extend the quake engine
 * Audio support for more platforms
 * Add OpenGL multi-pass texturing replacement for when multi-texturing
   extension isn't available
 * Remove dependency on GNU make or migrate to automake
 * Quake/QW Client: Add proper XFree86 DGA/VideoMode support to X-based targets
   on systems with XFree86 available
 * Prep Aftershock for a future merge with the main tree
 * Add localized volumetric fog, water, etc
 * Implement a wind (airflow) engine
 * Add a more modern portal engine
 * Add a terrain engine
 * Add cloudy skies, using the wind and fog engines
 * Add some options to the setup menu, ie. gl_ztrick and +mlook
 * Allow more video and bpp modes
 * Support for camera rooms ala Unreal
 * Make every object depend on dead-reckoning for network play, ie. no
   "moving entities"
 * Add XInput stuff
 * Allow any size console font to be used
 * Use dynamic memory
 * Remove arbitrary limits such as max number of players
 * Fixes for various exploits/cheats
 * Dynamically loaded (at run time) renderers
 * Optional basic server authentication
 * Pluggable server authentication
 * Enhanced console (improved history and cmdline editing)
 * Integrate some sort of packet compression ala Qizmo
 * Fix q1/qw smurf attack
 * Fix oversized packet QW server crash
 * DOS/Win support in autoconf
 * Backport QW's HUD stuff to UQuake
 * Implement colored lighting
 * Implement mp3 player
 * Implement mod/s3m/it/xm/etc player
 * Add compiled shared mod support .dll/.so, q2/q3-style
 * Finish Volumetric fog
 * Colored lighting for common tasks such as emitting a blue dynamic light
   from players with quad damage..
 * C equivalents of the SVGALib target's asm (Linux Alpha has SVGALib)
 * Wheel mouse support (make it bindable so that it can be bound to
   anything, ie. previous weapon/next weapon)
 * add threading support
 * add tty target (text quake) someone mentioned there is a text svgalib
 * add walls that emit light
 * port to Amiga (someone is working on this)
 * port to MacOS (this has already been done as a seperate project, ala
   the author does not wish to help merge his changes to our tree, so
   until then... no mac port)
 * add something like qstat to the multiplayer menu in qw so that we can
   just select servers to play on while in the game.
 * implement a "feign death" action, so that users can play dead
 * allow server admin to adjust air control (ie. in low gravity)
 * bullets leave "holes" in walls, and disappear as threshold is reached
 * make explosions also leave marks, but dynamic marks, ie. blast can
   affect multiple surfaces.
