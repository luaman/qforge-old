This file contains a (very incomplete) list of things to do still with the
QuakeForge project.  If you'd like to add something to this list or point
out that something has been done we forgot to remove, please send an email
to quake-devel@lists.sourceforge.net with details.

 * On unix systems /etc/quakerc should be read as a system-wide config
   file which should be able to specify console commands and other things
   like where to find the id1, qw, and other -game specified dirs
 * On unix systems ~/.quake should overlay a shared data directory.  Files
   in a user's ~/.quake directory should take precedence over files in the
   shared data dir and all files written should be placed into ~/.quake
 * sed 's/\<sprintf *(\([^,]\+\),/sprintf(\1, sizeof(\1)),/g' to fix some
   possible buffer overruns
 * configure.in: clean up the intel -mcpu stuff
 * Audio support for more platforms
 * Add OpenGL multi-pass texturing replacement for when multi-texturing
   extension isn't available
 * README: add tested platforms and results
 * Makefile.in, */Makefile.in: Add install target
 * Remove dependency on GNU make or migrate to automake
 * Quake/QW Client: Add proper XFree86 DGA/VideoMode support to X-based targets
   on systems with XFree86 available
 * Merge SDLQuake (BigM created a patch against an older revision of our
   main tree)
 * Add currently removed documentation to the README, and also add more
   information to explain things that we've done, or broken.
 * Prep Aftershock for a future merge with the main tree.
 * Add localized volumetric fog, water, etc.
 * Implement a wind (airflow) engine.
 * Add a more modern portal engine.
 * Add cloudy skies, using the wind and fog engines
 * Add some flags to the setup menu, ie. gl_ztrick and +mlook
 * Add gl_ztrick to the cvars saved in config.cfg
 * Allow more video and bpp modes
 * Make every object depend on dead-reckoning for network play, ie. no
   "moving entities"
 * Add XInput stuff
