This file contains a (very incomplete) list of things to do still with the
QuakeForge project.  If you'd like to add something to this list or point
out that something has been done we forgot to remove, please send an email
to quake-devel@lists.sourceforge.net with details.

 * On unix systems /etc/quakerc should be read as a system-wide config
   file which should be able to specify console commands and other things
   like where to find the id1, qw, and other -game specified dirs
 * On unix systems ~/.quake should overlay a shared data directory.  Files
   in a user's ~/.quake directory should take precedence over files in the
   shared data dir and all files written should be placed into ~/.quake
 * sed 's/\<sprintf *(\([^,]\+\),/sprintf(\1, sizeof(\1)),/g' to fix some
   possible buffer overruns
 * configure.in: clean up the intel -mcpu stuff
 * Audio support for more platforms
 * Add OpenGL multi-pass texturing replacement for when multi-texturing
   extension isn't available
 * README: add tested platforms and results
 * Makefile.in, */Makefile.in: Add install target
 * Remove dependency on GNU make or migrate to automake
 * Add default .cvsignore files to the tree
 * Makefile.in: rerun configure if configure is newer than Makefile, also
   rerun autoconf if configure.in is newer than configure
 * AUTHORS: There are some patches in the tree aren't attributed to their
   authors yet.  If your patch was applied and you haven't gotten a line
   in the AUTHORS file yet, please let us know so we can fix it.
 * Makefile.in */Makefile.in: developer-clean target ?
