This file contains a (very incomplete) list of things to do still with the
QuakeForge project.  If you'd like to add something to this list or point
out that something has been done we forgot to remove, please send an email
to quake-devel@lists.sourceforge.net with details.

 * On unix systems /etc/quakerc should be read as a system-wide config
   file which should be able to specify console commands and other things
   like where to find the id1, qw, and other -game specified dirs
 * On unix systems ~/.quake should overlay a shared data directory.  Files
   in a user's ~/.quake directory should take precedence over files in the
   shared data dir and all files written should be placed into ~/.quake
 * Devise and implement a way to ensure original gameplay compatibility
   while still letting us expand and extend the quake engine
 * Audio support for more platforms
 * Add OpenGL multi-pass texturing replacement for when multi-texturing
   extension isn't available

   on systems with XFree86 available
