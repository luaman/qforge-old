This file contains a (very incomplete) list of things to do still with the
QuakeForge project.  If you'd like to add something to this list or point
out that something has been done we forgot to remove, please send an email
to quake-devel@lists.sourceforge.net with details.

 * sed 's/\<sprintf *(\([^,]\+\),/sprintf(\1, sizeof(\1)),/g' to fix some
   possible buffer overruns

   extension isn't available
 * README: add tested platforms and results
 * Makefile.in, */Makefile.in: Add install target
 * Remove dependency on GNU make or migrate to automake
 * Add default .cvsignore files to the tree
 * Makefile.in: rerun configure if configure is newer than Makefile, also
   rerun autoconf if configure.in is newer than configure
 * AUTHORS: There are some patches in the tree aren't attributed to their
