QuakeForge Wishlist
-------------------

This file contains a listing of features people would like to see in the
QuakeForge engine.  These are different than bugs in that not having them
done will not affect the standard game as was playable before the initial
source release or subsequent accepted standards.  Those may be found in
the file ERRATA.

Note however that unlike the ERRATA file which contains issues that will
be addressed as sonn as possible, we make no promises for things listed
here.  Do keep in mind however that many of these things we want ourselves
so this file serves as a sort of to-do list.

DarkAngel <bhunn@zipworld.com.au>
 - 32 bit texture support
 - skeletal animations
 - larger console fonts
 - lens flares
 - better muzzle/weapon flashes
 - weapon model alpha
 - optimize flashblends if possible, possibly allow them to be made smaller
 - death anims that vary on how you die [this is a progs issue]
 - ability to bind modifier+key combos
 - better rocket/grenade trails
 - improve the GL particle system
 - more configurable sounds [progs issue]
 - model interpolation
 - landscape distance detail changes
 - BSP improvements, curves, animated textures, etc
 - Quake3ish quad/pent effect
 - Bounce pads
 - optimize graphics effects currently only doable with slow progs
 - status bar improvements
 - fix GL model mesh for "barely legal" models (perquake, old obsidian, etc)
 - fix "speed jumping" [not sure of cause, very hard to fix]
 - improve sound engine behavior when too many sounds play at once

Tonik <tonik@quake.ru>
 - enhanced say and say_team editing
 - add skill, coop, [match, powerups ?] qw-server cvars
 - single player & coop support (progs issue)
 - ffa and match support (progs)
 - make KP_* work on Win32 (will probably require keyboard dinput?)
 - pause in demo playback (qw, already done in uquake)
 - implement some teamplay macros into qw-client? Like $health, $armor
 - timescale server cvar (easy for uquake, requires new protocol for qw)
