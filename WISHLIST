QuakeForge Wishlist
-------------------

This file contains a listing of features people would like to see in the
QuakeForge engine.  These are different than bugs in that not having them
done will not affect the standard game as was playable before the initial
source release or subsequent accepted standards.  Those may be found in
the file ERRATA.

Note however that unline the ERRATA file which contains issues that will
be addressed as sonn as possible, we make no promises for things listed
here.  Do keep in mind however that many of these things we want ourselves
so this file serves as a sort of to-do list.
