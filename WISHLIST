QuakeForge Wishlist
-------------------

This file contains a listing of features people would like to see in the
QuakeForge engine.  These are different than bugs in that not having them
done will not affect the standard game as was playable before the initial
source release or subsequent accepted standards.  Those may be found in
the file ERRATA.

Note however that unlike the ERRATA file which contains issues that will
be addressed as sonn as possible, we make no promises for things listed
here.  Do keep in mind however that many of these things we want ourselves
so this file serves as a sort of to-do list.

Ambush
 - v_idlescale and force_centerview can mess with MegaTF concussion effects
 - gl_polyblend 0 can undo a flash grenade effect
 - binary sanity check
 - MOVETYPE_FLY in QW
 - view offset in QW
 - Software skyboxes
 - full 256 colors for particles in QW
 - alpha particles
 - resizable dlights
 - GL fullbrights
 - Beams ala Half-Life
 - EFFECT bit for entities (ie smoke trail for player on fire)
 - lens flares
 - MIDI engine
 - 16 channel sound
 - ability to play stereo sounds (dedicated channel for that maybe?)
 - positional audio allowing eg rocket flybys
 - allow mp3 sounds to reduce pak sizes [cache them to wav's maybe?]

DarkAngel <bhunn@zipworld.com.au>
 - 32 bit texture support
 - skeletal animations
 - larger console fonts
 - lens flares
 - better muzzle/weapon flashes
 - weapon model alpha
 - optimize flashblends if possible, possibly allow them to be made smaller
 - death anims that vary on how you die [this is a progs issue]
 - ability to bind modifier+key combos
 - better rocket/grenade trails
 - improve the GL particle system
 - more configurable sounds [progs issue]
 - model interpolation
 - landscape distance detail changes
 - BSP improvements, curves, animated textures, etc
 - Quake3ish quad/pent effect
 - Bounce pads
 - optimize graphics effects currently only doable with slow progs
 - status bar improvements
 - fix GL model mesh for "barely legal" models (perquake, old obsidian, etc)
 - standardise "speed jumping" [not sure of cause, very hard to fix]
   dependant on !something!, and works differently on different computers
 - improve sound engine behavior when too many sounds play at once

Tonik <tonik@quake.ru>
 - enhanced say and say_team editing
 - add skill, coop, [match, powerups ?] qw-server cvars
 - single player & coop support (mostly progs issue)
 - ffa and match support (progs)
x- make KP_* work on Win32
 - fix key_dest setting (it's often key_game instead of key_console)
 - pause in demo playback (qw, already done in uquake)
 - implement some teamplay macros into qw-client? Like $health, $armor
 - timescale server cvar (easy for uquake, requires new protocol for qw)
